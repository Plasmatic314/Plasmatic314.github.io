    <h3>I'm 15 years old. I was born and raised in the Bronx, my knowledge in code is my live's work.
        I was first inspired to code by a program called Roblox Studios. This program used script which allowed
        a person's game to function the way they wanted to. I started learning how to code by joining All-Star Code.
        The staff's assisted me whenever I had trouble with a certain type of error in my code.
